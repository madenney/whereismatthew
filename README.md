# Where is Matthew

A small project I created so my family and friends could easily track me as I tramped my way around the US for a year.


Upon visiting whereismatthew.com (no longer running), an API request would be made from a linode server to the GPS tracking software to get my location via the GPS I installed inside my van. Then it was rendered on an embedded google maps window along along with a timestamp indicating when it was last updated. Pretty simple but also effective at reminding everyone I was still alive without having them have to text me every five minutes.
